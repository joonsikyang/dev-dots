### :: Intro to Big O
- There's different approaches and implementations for the same task. Big O is about which one is best.
- " When dealing with a big application or a huge data, one algorithm implementation could save an hour every time it runs compared to another implementation. Performance matters at that point. There is an actual best algorithm."
- Big O is a numeric representation of the performance of the code
- It's a system of generalizing code and talking about it and comparing code and its performance to other pieces of code.
- Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches considering the context.
- When your code slows down or crashes, identifying parts of the code that are inefficient can help us find pain points in our applications.
- Less important: it comes up in interviews!
