### :: Objectives
1. Define what an algorithm is : A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.
2. Devise a plan to solve algorithms
3. Compare and contrast problem solving patterns

### :: Problem Solving Approach
- `Step 1 : Understand The Problem`
    - Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    - What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    - What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
    - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do I have enough information to solve the problem?)
    - How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
- `Step 2 : Explore Concrete Examples`
    - Start with simple examples with an input and the output.
    - Progress to more complex examples.
    - Explore examples with empty inputs.
    - Explore example with invalid inputs.
- `Step 3 : Break It Down`
    - Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.
- `Step 4 : Solve or Simplify`
    - Solve the problem.
    - If you can't, solve a simpler problem.
    - Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do.
    - Temporarily ignore that difficulty.
    - Write a simplified solution.
    - Then incorporate that difficulty back in.
- `Step 5 : Look Back and Refactor`
    - Can you check the result?
    - Can you derive the result differently?
    - Can you understand it at a glance?
    - Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
    - Can you improve the performance of your code?
    - Can you think of other ways to refactor?
    - How have other people solved this problem?
